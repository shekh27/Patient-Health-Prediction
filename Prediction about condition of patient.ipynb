In March of 2017 I didn&#039;t bleed for close to three weeks and then started bleeding again March 28th and have been bleeding every since. I have gained about 13 lbs so far since getting the birth control. Although for now the weight gain isn&#039;t a deal breaker for me but the bleeding is.. I am trying to be very patient to see how my body adjusts to the implant. It has been three months so far and I have my fingers crossed that my cycle will go away for awhile\"]\n",
